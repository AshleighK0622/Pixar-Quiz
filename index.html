  <p>The Pixar Quiz consists of 20 different questions based on facts not only found in the movies, but ones about the company itself. </p>
    <p>Each question in the quiz is of multiple-choice or "true or false" format.  Read each question carefully, and click on the button next to the response
        you think best answers the question. Repeat this step for all 20 questions.
    </p>
    <p>Once you have done this for all 20, click the 'Check Answers' button at the bottom of the page. You will then see your score out of a
      possible 20 points.
    </p>
    <p>The total score for the quiz is based on your response to the questions. If you respond incorrectly to a question or don't answer it at all,
      your quiz score will reflect that appropriately.
    </p>
    <p>Note that if you select an incorrect response for a question or skip over it entirely, you can try again until you get the correct response.</p>


    <p>Now that you know all the rules, are you ready to take the quiz?? </p>
    <p>If so, click on the PixarQuiz Tab to the right to officially start! Good luck! :)</p>
